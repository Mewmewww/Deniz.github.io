My name is Deniz Yandim, a 20 year old student here in NÃ¦stved who lives in Vordingborg. Not having many physical hobbies, programming or playing games were, by far - the most ideal way of killing time. Having been a student in STX rather than HTX - my programming capabilities weren't remotely high, but that takes me towards a branch of Computer Science that wasn't the most ideal choice - initiate Datalogi.

Datalogi was awful - having spent an entire year there, and me not knowing there were branches of Computer Science - Datalogi heavily focused on Discrete Mathematics, complex Algebra and very limited amount of programmming. The studies there were mind-boggling (in a bad way), and I were on the edge of never choosing Computer Science again. However, I was in contact with a friend of mine from the United Kingdoms, and he elaborated that Computer Science isn't a singular course - there are a plethora of branches under the exact same name. Knowing this now, finding the current course
