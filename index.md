That's me, you may wonder **who I am** and how I arrived here. 

# Who am I and what led me to this place?

My name is Deniz Yandim, a 20 year old student here in NÃ¦stved who lives in Vordingborg. Not having **any** physical hobbies, programming or playing games were, by far - the most ideal way of killing time. Having been a student in STX rather than HTX - my programming capabilities weren't remotely high, but that takes me towards a branch of Computer Science that wasn't the most ideal choice - initiate Datalogi.

_**Datalogi was awful**_ - having spent an entire year there, and me not knowing there were branches of Computer Science - Datalogi heavily focused on Discrete Mathematics, complex Algebra and very limited amount of programmming. The studies there were mind-boggling (in a bad way), and I were on the edge of never choosing Computer Science again. However, I was in contact with a friend of mine from the United Kingdoms, and he elaborated that Computer Science isn't a singular course - there are a plethora of branches under the exact same name. Knowing this now, I decided to choose Datamatiker as something I wanted to attempt, and I managed to recieve a spot for the course. 

# _On the day_

Having arrived at the academy and listening in on how the years are going to be structured - with limited Mathematics, no awfully complex Algebra with such a high probability of never being used in any regular work, and much more focus on how to program, develop systems, making them appliable to everyday tasks as well as users understanding the basics of said program. 

Our current goals have been to completely understand IntellJ IDEA - our compiling program, as well as understanding the fundamentals of Java and Github. A few snippets of what we've done so far in terms of code, can be the following:
