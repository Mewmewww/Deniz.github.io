That's me, you may wonder **who I am** and how I arrived here. 

# Who am I and what led me to this place?

My name is Deniz Yandim, a 20 year old student here in NÃ¦stved who lives in Vordingborg. Not having **any** physical hobbies, programming or playing games were, by far - the most ideal way of killing time. Having been a student in STX rather than HTX - my programming capabilities weren't remotely high, but that takes me towards a branch of Computer Science that wasn't the most ideal choice - initiate Datalogi.

_**Datalogi was awful**_ - having spent an entire year there, and me not knowing there were branches of Computer Science - I mistakenly thought that Datalogi was going to be my life from then to death. Datalogi however, heavily focused on Discrete Mathematics, complex Algebra and very limited amount of programmming. The studies there were mind-boggling (in a bad way), and I was on the edge of never choosing Computer Science again. However, I was in contact with a friend of mine from the United Kingdoms, and he elaborated that Computer Science isn't a singular course - there are a plethora of branches under the exact same name. Knowing this now, I decided to choose Datamatiker as something I wanted to attempt, and I managed to recieve a spot for the course. 

# _On the day_

Having arrived at the academy and listening in on how the years are going to be structured - with limited Mathematics, no awfully complex Algebra with such a high probability of never being used in any regular work, and much more focus on how to program, develop systems, making them appliable to everyday tasks as well as users understanding the basics of said program. 

Our current goals have been to completely understand IntellJ IDEA - our compiling program, as well as understanding the fundamentals of Java and Github. A few snippets of what we've done so far in terms of code, can be the following: 

```
public class Loop {
    // initializing the codeblock with pvsm
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using sout to shorten the length of the code.
        System.out.println("welcome to java, learning Java Now");
        System.out.println("Programming is fun");
        // Using a for-loop whilst simultaneously using an int-type to increase the statement, "I lova Java"
        // up to 5 times. ++i is adding the statement with an increment, until the loop has reached its maximum.
        for (int i = 0; i <= 4; ++i) {
            System.out.println("I love Java");
            
Writers note: This prints out "I love Java" 5 times. 

Additionally, we also worked out how to print out a properly looking table, with its rows and columns alligning perfectly.

// Declaring a table as a string, and making a limitation of 5 strings.
        String[][] table = new String[5][];
        table[0] = new String[] {"a", "a^2", "a^3","a^4"};
        table[1] = new String[] {"1",  "1" ,  "1" , "1" };
        table[2] = new String[] {"2",  "4",   "8" , "16"};
        table[3] = new String[] {"3", "9", "27", "81"};
        table[4] = new String[] {"4", "16", "64","256"};
        // Using a for loop, that will use the inbuilt functions of row and table to seperate them into rows and
        // in to a column form. Additionally, an inbuilt function of Java is System.out.format that will simply allign the
        // displayed code to the right or left - depending on whether you insert a - before 15.
        for (String[] row : table) {
            System.out.format("%15s%15s%15s%15s\n", row);
```
Being able to have on-hand assignments and work-schedules, than being over-burdened with theoretical examples have been such an enjoyable experience. 

# Present
Now we're at the present, enjoying myself with like-minded individuals who share a plethora of hobbies like my own - with teachers that are very practical in their teaching, who understands the importance of theory as well as practical work. Having worked on the recently released assignment (e.g. the snippets mentioned above), I have high expectations that this is what I believe I will continue doing to the very end.
